# Deploy a Web Application on EC2 with Auto Start, Security Group, and Monitoring

This project demonstrates how to deploy a web application on an AWS EC2 instance with:

- ✅ Apache web server setup
- 🔐 Custom security group for public access
- 🔁 Auto-start configuration on reboot
- 📈 CloudWatch monitoring for resource tracking

## 🔧 Requirements

- AWS EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2)
- Key Pair to SSH into instance
- Security Group allowing HTTP (80) and SSH (22)
- Internet access to install packages

---

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 🔹 1. Launch EC2 Instance

- AMI: **Amazon Linux 2**
- Instance Type: `t2.micro` (Free Tier)
- Key Pair: Use or create one (e.g., `my-key.pem`)
- Security Group Rules:
  - **HTTP (80):** `0.0.0.0/0`
  - **SSH (22):** Your IP only
- Launch and wait until the instance is running.

---

### 🔹 2. Connect to Instance

```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@3.88.135.6
🔹 3. Install Apache and Deploy Website
bash
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
Copy your HTML file to the Apache root:

bash
Copy code
sudo cp my_work.html /var/www/html/index.html
✅ Now open in your browser:
cpp
Copy code
http://3.88.135.6
🔹 4. Auto-Start on Reboot
Create a script:

bash
Copy code
nano /home/ec2-user/startup.sh
Paste:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
Then:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x startup.sh
crontab -e
Add this line at the bottom:

bash
Copy code
@reboot /home/ec2-user/startup.sh
🔹 5. Setup CloudWatch Monitoring (Optional)
Install agent:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y
Create /opt/cloudwatch-agent/config.json with:

json
Copy code
{
  "metrics": {
    "metrics_collected": {
      "cpu": {
        "measurement": ["cpu_usage_idle", "cpu_usage_iowait"],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60
      },
      "mem": {
        "measurement": ["mem_used_percent"],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60
      }
    }
  }
}
Start the agent:

bash
Copy code
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
-a fetch-config \
-m ec2 \
-c file:/opt/cloudwatch-agent/config.json \
-s
🌐 Final App URL
cpp
Copy code
http://3.88.135.6
Your site should now be publicly accessible and auto-start even after a reboot.

📌 Notes
You can replace my_work.html with any HTML project.

Use systemctl status httpd to verify Apache service.

Use CloudWatch to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage over time.

✅ Why CloudWatch is Recommended
1. Real-Time Monitoring of EC2 Health
Keeps track of CPU, memory, disk usage, and network traffic

Helps you detect resource spikes, bottlenecks, or downtime instantly

2. Automatic Alerts & Notifications
You can set alarms (like: CPU > 70% for 5 mins)

Alerts you via email/SMS using Amazon SNS

Great for early detection of performance issues or attacks

3. Troubleshooting & Debugging
Helps you answer: Why is my app slow? Why did my EC2 crash?

Visualize usage patterns over time

4. Cost Optimization
You can:

Spot underutilized instances (wasting money)

Spot overused ones (may need upgrading)

5. Automatic Scaling (if needed later)
CloudWatch metrics are used by Auto Scaling Groups

Helps you scale your app up or down automatically

6. Logging & Auditing
You can push system logs, app logs, or Nginx logs to CloudWatch Logs

Useful for compliance, auditing, and historical tracking

7. Peace of Mind
You don’t have to log in to the server every time to check if things are okay.

You get notifications before your users notice issues.

🔒 Why Elastic IP is Recommended:
Normal EC2 IP changes every reboot

Elastic IP is static and permanent (until you release it)

Great for:

Hosting web apps

DNS routing

Maintaining uptime
